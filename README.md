# Division of Labor

Each member took part in writing code and designing the system and we believe the division of labor was fair. To break it down by focused contribution:

Chaoyu: Primarily coding
Aniket: Progress report, secondary coding
Greg: Literature review, design, paper
Conrad: Dataset, Matlab coding, design, poster, paper
